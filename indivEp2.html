                        <h4>
                       Ammonites are the extinct group who made up the subclass Ammonoidea of the class Cephalopoda. They are of the phylum Mollusca, and are therefore exclusively marine creatures.</h4> <p>
                        <br>This group first appeared on Earth’s surface 415 million years ago during the Devonian period of the Paleozoic era. They existed as small, straight shelled creatures, known as Bacrites as first, but quickly evolved. Their sizes ranged from being only a couple centimetres across to being over 2 metres in diameter. They also evolved into a variety of shapes, including hairpins.</p>
                        <p>
                        Ammonites were the free-swimming molluscs of the ancient oceans. They had series of spiraled chambers, with the animal living in the last and the largest, known as the body chamber. Ammonites would often fill the other chambers with gas or fluid, allowing them to sink like a stone to avoid predation. Another mechanism of avoiding predation sometimes used was squirting ink, like modern cephalopods do. 
                        </p><p>
                        The fossilized shells found of Ammonites are usually beautiful spirals. The chambers of the shell were divided by walls known as septa. These strengthened the shell and stopped it from being crushed from external water pressure, allowing Ammonites to live at depths of up to 100 m. 

                        </p><p>
                        The gas or fluid filled chambers mentioned earlier also allowed for control of buoyancy and movement, like in a submarine. They also moved by jet propulsion, expelling water through a funnel-like opening to propel themselves in the opposite direction. Ammonites lived for two years on average, although some species survived beyond this.

                        Ammonites were some of the major predators during their time, feeding on most living marine creatures, including fish and even other cephalopods. Their method of attack is thought to be similar to modern cephalopods, consisting of the silent stalking of their prey, followed by rapidly extending their tentacles to grasp the target. Once caught, the prey could be easily devoured by the animal’s powerful jaws, located at the base of the tentacles, between the eyes.
                        </p><p>
                            Throughout their existence, Ammonites faced 3 catastrophic events which would eventually lead to their extinction. Interestingly, they lived, suffered, and became extinct with a very similar timeline to the dinosaurs. The first event was the Permian extinction 250 million years ago, which caused all but 10% of Ammonite species to perish. These species went on to flourish during the Triassic era, but faced extinction again 206 million years ago.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        This event marked the beginning of the Jurassic era, with only one Ammonite species surviving to enter it. Ammonites began to thrive once again during the Jurassic era, but ultimately became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period when all species were annihilated. Ammonite fossils are excellent guide fossils for stratigraphy, which is how geologists find out where exactly on the geological time scale certain rock layers belong. This is for a variety of reasons. First of all, Ammonites evolved so rapidly that each species has a relatively short life span and can be dated precisely. They are also found in a large variety of marine sedimentary rocks. Furthermore, they are fairly common and easy to identify, and are distributed worldwide.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The most important reason is the rapidity of Ammonite evolution. Ammonites can be used to distinguish intervals of geological time of less than 200 000 years, which is essential for the purpose of correlation. Rock layers containing Ammonite fossils can often be dated to specific geological periods. This information can then be used to date other species in the vicinity to the same periods.
